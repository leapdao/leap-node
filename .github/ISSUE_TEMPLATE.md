# How to create a new bounty?

1. Create an issue with bounty description and bounty and draft tags in an appropriate repository.
   If the bounty spans across multiple repositories, consider splitting it in a smaller per-repo bounties if possible.
   The bounty definition should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time bound)
2. Submit proposal via the bounty form: http://bounty.leapdao.org/viewform
3. Add the bounty to the bounties board: https://github.com/orgs/leapdao/projects/6
4. If no objections for 2 days, the bounty is considered approved

# Bounty sizes
XS / 200 DAI / effort ~ 3h
S / 350 DAI / effort ~5h 
M / 550 DAI / effort ~8h
L / 900 DAI / effort ~13h
XL / 1400 DAI / effort ~21h

# Pair programming
If 2 people claim the bounty together, the payout increases by 1.5x.

# Bounty Challenge
If bounty has no progress for 4 days, then anyone can challenge the bounty. Once the bounty is challenged, the worker has 3 more days to deliver some progress on the bounty (gardener can make exception and extend period to 5 days 1x, unless gardener is also working). If worker fails to make progress within period, the bounty is up for grabs by anyone.

# Payout
Only bounties from the current sprint(if any) are payed out. Unless you are newbie (never earned a bounty before), then you get 1 exception.
